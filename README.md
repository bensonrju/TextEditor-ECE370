# TextEditor-ECE370
This program is a basic text editor and serves as the final project for the W23 ECE370-01 class project.

This program runs off of the openFrameworks toolkit and as such anyone who wants to build and run this program themselves is going to need an instance of this running on their machine. 

Instructions on how to install openFrameworks can be found here: https://openframeworks.cc/download/

Once openFrameworks is installed, the easiest way to get this programming up and running locally is by making an empty openFrameworks project and adding the files from this repo to the "src" folder.
